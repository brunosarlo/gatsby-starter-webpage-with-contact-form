## About

    I build this code for my personal website https://bruno.sarlo.uy mostly as a portfolio of my work. I might extend this Gatsby starter later to have a blog too.

    Feel free to re-use!

## Features

    * Some original design layout for your enjoyment
    * Fully adatable, crossbrowser layout and text.
    * Fontawesome
    * Google font
    * SEO optimized with React Helmet
    * Tailwind incuded (based on https://github.com/mjsarfatti/gatsby-starter-tailwind-opinionated)
    * Tailwind forms
    * Contact form with PHP backend (based on https://github.com/frankagathos/gatsby-with-php-form)
## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using this starter
    gatsby new my-tailwind-starter https://github.com/brunosarlo/gatsby-starter-webpage-with-contact-form.git
    ```
1.  **Install NPM packages.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and install NPM packages.

    ```shell
    cd gatsby-starter-webpage-with-contact-form/
    npm install
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Run Gatsby in development mode

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

1.  **Configure PHP form**

    Edit info at `config.php` and `sendmail.php` files at `/static/api/contact` to your email.
    Edit the PHP form endpoint at `/src/components/Form.js`
